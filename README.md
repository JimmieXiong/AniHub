# AniHub: Anime & Donghua Streaming Platform

## Overview
AniHub is a streaming platform for anime and donghua, designed to be a centralized hub for easier content discovery and viewing. It lets users search, browse, and stream a variety of anime and donghua through a straightforward, easy-to-use interface.

## Developer

## NOTE:
This is an **educational project**—there are many bugs, and it is **definitely not ready for deployment**. However, with more time and effort, it could definitely become something bigger!

- AniHub makes it easy to find and stream anime and donghua—though, fair warning, it depends on whether or not scraping gets blocked.
- Tried to design the platform just the way I imagined it, keeping it simple. Users can easily search and navigate through all the content.
- AniHub uses a tweaked version of the [Anime-API](https://github.com/falcon71181/Anime-API) to pull in content data and enhance the user experience.

## Project Insights
This project has been a great learning experience. I got to experience how anime streaming platforms like Kissanime and GOGOAnime work under the hood. Developing AniHub gave me hands-on experience with building a content streaming platform, integrating APIs, and dealing with all the challenges of content delivery.
